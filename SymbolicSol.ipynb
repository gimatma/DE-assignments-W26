    "There are two common approaches to solving mathematical problems with computers. **Numerical computing** uses algorithms to find an *approximation of the solution*; with this approach, the goal is high precision (small error) and efficiency (be fast while handling huge data sets). The Euler method for solving differential equations is an example of a numerical algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **symbolical computing** is like asking the computer to do algebra for you. This approach treats mathematical expressions as objects rather than numerical values and produces *exact analytical solutions* (formulas). "
